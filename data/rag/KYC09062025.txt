A: KYC Identifier means the unique number or code assigned to a customer of an RE by the Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR). If the customer approaches an RE for opening an account, he can provide his KYC Identifier and give consent to the RE to download the valid KYC data from CKYCR. This can obviate the need for the customer to submit KYC documents again while opening an account with another RE. 
Q: Can the KYC Identifier be used for any other purpose? 
A: In addition to the purpose of establishing an account-based relationship, KYC Identifier can be used for updation/ periodic updation of KYC, or for verification of identity of a customer. Further details in this regard are given in paragraph 56(j) of the Master Direction on KYC.

(www.ckycindia.in). 
Q: It is easy to use KYC Identifier for opening an account. Whether any measure has been taken to improve its use by the REs? 
A: For the purpose of opening an account, RE is required to seek the KYC Identifier from the customer or retrieve the same, if available, from the CKYCR and obtain KYC records  by using such KYC Identifier. In such cases, the customer is not required to submit the same KYC records/ information/ any other additional identification documents, unless– 
(a) there is a change in the information of the customer as existing in the records of CKYCR; or 
(b) the KYC record or information retrieved is incomplete or is not as per the current applicable KYC norms; or

Q: What is Video-based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP)? 
A: V-CIP is an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence that allows REs to obtain and verify a customer’s identity information through a digital, secure, live, informed and consent-based and live audiovisual interaction between an authorised RE official and the customer to obtain identification information required for CDD purpose. V-CIP eliminates the need for physical visit to a branch of the RE but is treated on par with face-to-face CIP. Assisted V-CIP is also permitted when banks take help of Business Correspondents (BCs) facilitating the process only at the customer end.   
Q: Whether blinking of eyes or making specific facial gestures are mandatory to complete V-CIP? 
A: No, making specific facial gesture like blinking of eyes, smiling, frowning, etc. are not mandatory for liveness check. The RE is required to take due cognizance of special need, if any, of the customer during liveness check. 
 
Q: What are the purposes for which V-CIP can be used by an RE? 
A: V-CIP may be used for carrying out the following processes: 
(a) to undertake CDD in case of onboarding a new individual customer, proprietor in case of proprietorship firm, authorised signatories and beneficial owners in case of Legal Entity customers; 
(b) to convert existing account opened in non-face-to-face mode using Aadhaar OTP based e-KYC authentication; and 
(c) for updation/ periodic updation of KYC records of eligible customers. 
Q: Why does an RE periodically ask for KYC documents from the customer when the customer has already submitted the same during opening of account? 
A: RE is required to update the customers’ KYC records as part of ongoing due diligence process to ensure that the information or data collected under CDD is kept up to date and relevant. The periodicity of such updation depends on the risk categorisation of the customer by the RE and such periodic updation of KYC records (at times referred to as re-KYC) shall be carried out at least once in every two years for high-risk, eight years for medium risk and ten years for low-risk customers. However, RE may adopt any additional and exceptional measures as per its internal KYC policy which inter alia may require physical presence of the customer, periodic updation of KYC only in the branch of the RE where account is maintained, a more frequent periodicity of KYC updation than the minimum specified periodicity, etc.  
Q: What are the parameters used by the RE for risk categorisation of a customer? 
A: The broad indicative parameters prescribed for customer’s risk categorisation are customer’s identity, social/ financial status, nature of business activity, information about the customer’s business and his/ her location, geographical risk covering customer as well as transactions, type of products/ services offered, delivery channel used for delivery of products/ services, types of transaction undertaken – cash, cheque/monetary instruments, wire transfers, forex transactions, etc. While considering customer’s identity, the ability to confirm identity documents through online or other services offered by issuing authorities may also be factored in. The risk category and reasons thereof are not required to be divulged to the customers by the RE. 
Q: What are the modes for periodic updation of KYC for individual customers? 
A: The modes for periodic updation of KYC for individuals are as under: 
(a) It can be undertaken at the branch of the RE with which customer maintains the account or any other branch of the same RE; or 
(b) RE can obtain a self-declaration when there is “no change in KYC information” and also when there is “change only in address details”, through customer’s email-id/ mobile number registered with the RE, ATMs, digital channels (such as online banking / internet banking, mobile application of RE), letter, etc. However, the declared address shall be verified by the RE through positive confirmation within two months; or 
(c) Aadhaar OTP based e-KYC in non-face-to-face (NF2F) mode and V-CIP; 
(d) RE is also mandated to update customer’s KYC records based on the update information/ notification, if any, received from CKYCR for the customer concerned.
Q: What documents are needed for periodic updation of KYC? 
A: The requirement of KYC documents depends on the modes used for periodic updation of KYC as detailed in the reply to Q 24, above.  
(a) In case of change in the KYC information, the customer has to provide the documents as mentioned in the reply to Q 5 above; 
(b) In case of no change in KYC information, the customer can provide a selfdeclaration. Similarly, a self-declaration in case of change only in address can also be provided by the customer to RE as detailed in reply to Q 24 above. 
(c) In case of Aadhaar OTP-based e-KYC authentication facility in non-face-to-face mode, the customer can provide a declaration of the current address even if the current address is different from the address in Aadhaar database. However, RE shall ensure that mobile number for Aadhaar authentication is same as the one available with it in the customer’s profile, in order to prevent any fraud. 
(d) In case of use of V-CIP for completing re-KYC, the requirements shall be as per paragraph 18 of the Master Direction on KYC, which include identification and verification of the identity using (i) Aadhaar OTP based e-KYC authentication in non-face-to-face mode; (ii) offline verification of Aadhaar; (iii) KYC records downloaded from CKYCR; and (iv) equivalent e-documents including documents issued through DigiLocker.
